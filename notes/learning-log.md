# Learning Log

## Why this project exists
I want to understand how agent orchestration frameworks (LangGraph) work in
practice, especially for creative pipelines that require consistency.

## Initial assumptions
- Agents should produce structured outputs
- Images come last
- Reproducibility matters more than creativity

## Open questions
- Where does agent autonomy actually help?
- Where does it hurt?
