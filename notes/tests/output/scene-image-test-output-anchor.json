"image_prompt": "A painted storybook fantasy illustration of a grassy field in soft pastels and warm greens, with a leafy hedge forming the background and a dark rabbit-hole opening at its base in the foreground. Alice is depicted as: A young girl with shoulder-length light brown hair, wearing a simple knee-length blue dress without additional layers or accessories. She stands in the grass turned toward the White Rabbit, her body angled forward as if about to follow. The White Rabbit is an anthropomorphic white rabbit with pink eyes, wearing a waistcoat with a small watch visible at its pocket, positioned near the rabbit-hole. The lighting is gentle and warm with golden highlights, maintaining a whimsical, curious, and gently dreamlike tone, moderate visual detail, and a child-appropriate painted storybook style."
