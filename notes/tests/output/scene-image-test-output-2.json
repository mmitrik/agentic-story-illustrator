"image_prompt": "A painted storybook fantasy illustration of a deep, vertical well fading into darkness, rendered in muted blues and soft golden highlights. Along the curved walls, shelves and cupboards appear to float, holding books, maps, and jars, including one clearly labeled 'ORANGE MARMALADE.' Alice, a human child with a simple, non-descript appearance, is shown suspended midair at the center of the well, her body gently oriented downward as she descends. Her hair drifts lightly around her head, and she gazes outward with a calm, attentive expression. The lighting is soft and dim, with a dreamlike glow that maintains a whimsical, child-appropriate painted storybook style and moderate visual detail."
