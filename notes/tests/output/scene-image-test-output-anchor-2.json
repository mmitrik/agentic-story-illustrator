"image_prompt": "A painted storybook fantasy illustration of a deep, vertical well fading into darkness, rendered in muted blues with soft golden highlights. The curved walls of the well are lined with floating shelves and cupboards holding books, maps, and jars, including one clearly labeled 'ORANGE MARMALADE.' At the center of the composition is Alice, depicted as: A young girl with shoulder-length light brown hair, wearing a simple knee-length blue dress without additional layers or accessories. She is suspended in the air within the well, gently oriented downward, with her hair drifting around her face. The lighting is dim but soft and child-appropriate, creating a whimsical, gently dreamlike atmosphere with moderate visual detail in a painted storybook style."
