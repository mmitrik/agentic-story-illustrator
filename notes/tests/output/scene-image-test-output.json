"image_prompt": "A painted storybook fantasy illustration of a grassy field bordered by a hedge, rendered in soft pastels and warm greens. In the foreground, a dark rabbit-hole opens at the base of the hedge. The White Rabbit, an anthropomorphic white rabbit with pink eyes, wears a waistcoat and is positioned near the hole with a small watch visible at its pocket. Nearby, Alice, a human child with a simple, non-descript appearance, stands in the grass turned toward the rabbit, her body angled as if about to follow. The lighting is gentle and warm, with golden highlights and a whimsical, dreamlike tone, moderate visual detail, and a child-appropriate painted storybook style."
